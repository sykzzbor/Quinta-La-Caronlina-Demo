## Reserve Monospaced Fonts for Short Blocks

Monospaced fonts reduce readability in long text: uniform letter widths disrupt reading rhythm. Use them only for code blocks, terminal output, and short stylistic elements. Never set body copy in a monospaced face.

**Incorrect (monospace for body text):**

```css
body {
  font-family: 'Fira Mono', monospace;
  font-size: 16px;
}
```

**Correct (proportional for body, mono for code):**

```css
body {
  font-family: 'Inter', sans-serif;
  font-size: 18px;
}

code, pre {
  font-family: 'Fira Code', 'Fira Mono', monospace;
  font-size: 0.9em;
}
```

Brief monospaced sections (a stylistic data readout, a hero element) are fine as a design choice; keep them short.
