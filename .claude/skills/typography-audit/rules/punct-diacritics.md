## Support Accented Characters and Diacritics

Ensure fonts include all needed accented characters. Use correct diacritics (café, not cafe; naïve, not naive). Store accents as Unicode characters, not composed sequences. Avoid over-subsetting, which strips accented glyphs.

**Incorrect (missing diacritics, wrong encoding):**

```html
<meta charset="iso-8859-1">
<p>The cafe serves a prix fixe menu with creme brulee.</p>
```

**Correct (UTF-8 with proper diacritics):**

```html
<meta charset="utf-8">
<p>The caf&eacute; serves a prix fixe menu with cr&egrave;me br&ucirc;l&eacute;e.</p>
```

Verify glyph coverage before selecting a font: test content covering all target languages. Avoid subsetting that removes accented ranges.
