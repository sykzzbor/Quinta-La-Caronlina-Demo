## Use Line Breaks or Indents, Not Both

Separate paragraphs with either vertical space (line breaks) or indentation, never both (an indent after a line break is redundant). Line breaks are the web default and aid scanning; indents feel formal and classical, flowing longform content more smoothly.

**Incorrect (both indent and space):**

```css
p {
  text-indent: 1.5em;
  margin-bottom: 1.5em; /* double separation */
}
```

**Correct (line breaks only, the web default):**

```css
p {
  margin-bottom: 1em;
  text-indent: 0;
}
```

**Or indents only (longform/editorial):**

```css
p {
  margin-bottom: 0;
  text-indent: 1.5em;
}

p:first-of-type {
  text-indent: 0; /* no indent on first paragraph */
}
```
