## Adapt Typography Across Breakpoints

Scale headings down on smaller screens. Swap display faces to text faces on small screens via media queries: display cuts with fine details lose legibility at small sizes. Limit long light-on-dark text on mobile where screen glare reduces contrast.

**Incorrect (desktop type unchanged on mobile):**

```css
h1 {
  font-family: 'Playfair Display', serif;
  font-size: 72px; /* stays huge on mobile */
}
```

**Correct (responsive scaling and font swapping):**

```css
h1 {
  font-family: 'Playfair Display', serif;
  font-size: 48px;
}

@media (max-width: 768px) {
  h1 {
    font-family: 'Source Serif Pro', serif; /* text cut for small screens */
    font-size: 28px;
    line-height: 1.2;
  }
}
```

Identify display faces by their naming: Display, Banner, Headline, Poster, Titling. These should not appear at body sizes on any screen.
