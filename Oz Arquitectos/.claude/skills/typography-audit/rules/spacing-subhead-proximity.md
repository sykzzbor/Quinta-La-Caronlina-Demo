## Place Subheadings Closer to Following Content

Give a subheading more space above (separating it from prior content) than below (connecting it to the content it introduces). This proximity groups the heading with its section. Use extra space above large subheaders.

**Incorrect (equal spacing, heading floats between sections):**

```css
h2 {
  margin-top: 1.5rem;
  margin-bottom: 1.5rem;
}
```

**Correct (more space above, less below):**

```css
h2 {
  margin-top: 2.5rem;
  margin-bottom: 0.75rem;
}

h3 {
  margin-top: 2rem;
  margin-bottom: 0.5rem;
}
```

The larger the heading, the more top margin it needs to separate from the preceding section.
