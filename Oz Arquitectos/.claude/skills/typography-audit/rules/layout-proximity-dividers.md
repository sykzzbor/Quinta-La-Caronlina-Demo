## Use Proximity and Dividers to Clarify Associations

Place captions and descriptions close to the images or elements they describe. Use dividers (horizontal rules) to separate unrelated sections, placing them above headings, not below: a divider below a heading underlines it (a Victorian convention) and weakens its link to the content.

**Incorrect (divider below heading, caption far from image):**

```html
<h2>Our Process</h2>
<hr>  <!-- separates heading from its content -->
<p>We follow a three-step approach...</p>

<img src="photo.jpg" alt="Team meeting">

<p class="caption">The team during a strategy session.</p>
<!-- Caption is far from image if other content intervenes -->
```

**Correct (divider above heading, caption adjacent to image):**

```html
<hr>  <!-- separates from previous section -->
<h2>Our Process</h2>
<p>We follow a three-step approach...</p>

<figure>
  <img src="photo.jpg" alt="Team meeting">
  <figcaption>The team during a strategy session.</figcaption>
</figure>
```
