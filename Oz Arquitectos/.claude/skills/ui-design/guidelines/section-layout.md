# Section Layout

Covers: page sections, constrained containers, centered vs left-aligned layouts, section padding, grids, stacked content alignment.

## Design Rules

- Align left-aligned sections to the page container edge: never narrow `max-w-*` + `mx-auto`; use a page-level `max-w-*` and constrain inner content separately.
- Align containers and boundings that occupy the same proportion across stacked sections: e.g. a 1/2-width card grid and a 1/2-width split with bounding below share the same column edges. Use consistent grid definitions and gap values so edges line up when scrolling.
- Avoid nested max-width on grids/lists that fill their container: if a feature grid or icon list spans the full constrained width, don't add a narrower `max-w-*`; align it to the page container edges, not floating in the middle. Nested `max-w-*` is fine for self-contained units meant to feel bounded (pricing cards, forms, comparison tables, centered media).
- Use a three-step spacing rhythm so grouping reads from the gaps: tightest within a group, more between groups, most between sections (e.g. 8px / 16px / 32-40px). Keep the same jumps across the page, not per-spot gaps.
- Give shared chrome one owner. Before adding a page title, global action, close or done control, or navigation affordance in a leaf component, inspect the shell and layout so it renders exactly once.
- Keep captions, helper text, and status lines in the tightest spacing group with the media or control they explain.
- Size compact forms, dialogs, and focused panels to their task and content before expanding to available width. Empty canvas is valid when it protects the glance path.
- Measure spacing between visible contrast edges, not invisible boxes. If a block has a tinted background, the section gap starts at the background edge, not at the first line of text inside it.
- Every element should align to a neighbor or a grid edge for a reason. Floating offsets are only acceptable when they create an intentional optical correction or hierarchy.
- In rows or columns of mixed visual weight, order from heaviest to lightest with the heaviest element on the outside edge. This keeps action groups and link clusters stable when scanned.

## Coding Rules

- Two-element pattern for constrained sections: outer handles background and vertical padding, inner handles max-width, centering, and horizontal padding:

  ```html
  <... class="{vertical-padding}">
    <... class="{max-width} mx-auto {horizontal-padding}">
      ...
    </...>
  </...>
  ```

  Apply consistently across all sections so content edges align when scrolling.
